# Flex-Coffee
A Static Website for a Fictional Coffee Company Made w/ Flexbox

## Goal

The goal is to create a static brochure-like website for a fictional coffee company using only Flexbox. Since I have not learned JS yet, in the context of website-building, the only languages expected to be used are HTML & CSS. 

The finished product should be responsive for various screen sizes.
